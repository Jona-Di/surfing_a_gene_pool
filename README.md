# Surfing a Gene Pool

[![CC BY 4.0][cc-by-shield]][cc-by]

This explorable illustrates the expansion of a bacterial population on a two-dimensional substrate. The population is made up of different mutants with identical fitness. Despite idential fitness patterns emerge
consist of sectoral regions dominated by one of the mutants.

The explorable is part of the [**Complexity Exporables Collection**](https://www.complexity-explorables.org). For more information about the system and its behavior consult the explorable
> [**“Surfing a Gene Pool” - Expansion of clones with idential fitness**](https://www.complexity-explorables.org/explorables/surfing-a-gene-pool/)

## Installation & Use

Out of the box you can use the explorable in a basic `index.html` file like this

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1">
		<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@explorables/surfing_a_gene_pool"></script>
	</head>
	<body class="avenir pa3 pa5-ns tj">
	    <div id="explorable_container"></div>
	</body>
	<script type="text/javascript">
		surfing_a_gene_pool.load("explorable_container")
	</script>
</html>
```
The header `<script>` tag loads the bundle, the `<div>` in the document is the container in which the explorable gets anchored when the function `surfing_a_gene_pool.load()` gets executed at the bottom. The `load` function needs the `<div>` container `id` as an argument.

## Installing the whole package locally

Clone repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dirkbrockmann/surfing_a_gene_pool.git
```


Go to the directory, install, build and show using `npm`:

1. `cd surfing_a_gene_pool`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run build`
4. `npm run show`
